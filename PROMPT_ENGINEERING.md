# Prompt Engineering & AI Agent Design in TravelBot

*See also: [README.md](README.md), [USE_CASES.md](USE_CASES.md), and [API_SETUP_GUIDE.md](API_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for related documentation.*

This document details the prompt engineering and AI agent design techniques used in TravelBot. It focuses on how the system leverages advanced prompting, function calling, batching, persona assignment, and other strategies to deliver a robust, context-aware travel assistant.

## 1. Persona Assignment (Role-Play)
**Technique:**
- Assigns a clear, expert persona: "TravelBot, an expert AI travel assistant." This shapes tone, expertise, and user engagement.
- Persona is reinforced in the system prompt and throughout the conversation.

**Example:**
> You are TravelBot, an expert AI travel assistant powered by real-time data and external APIs. Your mission is to provide comprehensive, personalized travel guidance that helps users plan amazing trips.

## 2. System Prompt Engineering
**Technique:**
- Uses a comprehensive system prompt to define capabilities, communication style, and formatting rules.
- Instructs the agent to use markdown, emojis, headers, and always fetch real-time data via function calls.

**Example:**
- Use proper markdown formatting for structure and readability
- Use **bold** for important details like hotel names, prices, ratings
- Always use the available functions to get real-time data

## 3. Function Calling (Tool Use)
**Technique:**
- Enables the agent to call backend functions (hotel search, flight search, weather, activities, currency conversion) using OpenAI's function calling.
- Fetches up-to-date, context-specific information and integrates it into responses.

**Example:**
User: "Find me a hotel in Paris for next weekend."
- The agent triggers `search_hotels` with the correct parameters, receives structured data, and formats the response for the user.

## 4. Batching & Multi-Step Reasoning
**Technique:**
- Chains multiple function calls in a single user interaction (e.g., find hotels, then suggest activities, then check weather).
- Delivers comprehensive, multi-faceted answers and itineraries.

**Example:**
User: "Plan a 3-day trip to Rome."
- The agent: 1) finds hotels, 2) suggests activities, 3) checks weather, 4) presents a combined itinerary.

## 5. Context Management (Conversation Memory)
**Technique:**
- Maintains conversation history, including user and assistant messages, to support multi-turn, context-aware conversations.
- Remembers user preferences, previous queries, and resolves references (e.g., "the same dates").

**Example:**
User: "Find me a hotel in Paris."
Assistant: [Shows hotel options]
User: "What about flights from London to Paris on the same dates?"
- The agent uses previous context to infer dates and destination.

## 6. Response Formatting & User Experience
**Technique:**
- Uses markdown, headers, bullet points, and emojis to make responses clear, visually appealing, and easy to scan.
- Formatting rules are embedded in the system prompt and followed in every response.

**Example:**
1. Hotel Options in Paris
   - **Grand Paris Hotel**
     - Price: $200/night
     - Rating: 4.7
     - Amenities: WiFi, Pool, Gym

## 7. Error Handling & Fallbacks
**Technique:**
- If an external API fails or is unavailable, the agent uses mock/fallback data to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Communicates gracefully about any limitations or missing data.

**Example:**
> "Sorry, I couldn't reach the live hotel database, but here are some popular options in Paris."

## 8. Tool/Function Definitions & Mapping
**Technique:**
- All available functions are defined with clear schemas and descriptions, enabling the agent to select and call the right tool for each user request.
- Handles multiple types of queries (hotels, flights, weather, activities, currency) and can combine them as needed.

## 9. Proactive Guidance & Clarification
**Technique:**
- Instructed to ask clarifying questions, offer alternatives, and proactively suggest complementary services (e.g., after booking a hotel, suggest activities or flights).

**Example:**
> "Would you like to see more hotel options, add flights, or customize your itinerary?"

## 10. Multi-Modal Output (Planned/Future)
**Technique:**
- Designed to support not just text, but also images, maps, and other rich content in the future.

## 11. Extensibility & Modularity
**Technique:**
- The agent is built to be easily extended with new tools, APIs, and prompt strategies as requirements evolve.
- Modular function definitions and prompt templates allow for rapid iteration and scaling.
