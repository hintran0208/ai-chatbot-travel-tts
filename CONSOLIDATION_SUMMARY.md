# Travel Assistant Chatbot - File Consolidation Summary

## ✅ Consolidation Complete

**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully completed  

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Backend Consolidation**
- ✅ **Merged `main1.py` and `main2.py` into unified `main.py`**
  - Combined personalization features from main1.py
  - Integrated speech speed control from main2.py
  - Added all missing dependencies (librosa, scipy.io.wavfile)
  - Fixed TTS functionality with proper audio generation
  - Enhanced process flow with both features working together

### 2. **Template Consolidation**
- ✅ **Unified templates into single `templates/` directory**
  - `templates/index.html` - Main chat interface with both personalization toggle and speech speed control
  - `templates/result.html` - Results template
  - All frontend features are now in one cohesive interface

### 3. **TTS System Improvements**
- ✅ **Fixed TTS file access issues on Windows**
  - Replaced temporary file usage with BytesIO buffers
  - Eliminated "file being used by another process" errors
  - Disabled problematic OpenAI TTS due to 404 errors
  - Prioritized local TTS model with speed control

### 4. **File Cleanup**
- ✅ **Organized project structure**
  - Moved old files to `backup_old_files/` directory
  - `main1.py`, `main2.py` → backed up
  - `templates1/`, `template2/` → backed up
  - Clean project structure with single consolidated files

## 🔧 Key Technical Fixes

### **TTS System**
```python
# Fixed file access issues
- OLD: tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() → File access errors
+ NEW: BytesIO() buffers → Clean memory operations

# Enhanced audio processing
- Added librosa for speed control
- Used soundfile for better audio handling
- Implemented fallback TTS strategies
```

### **Feature Integration**
```python
# WebSocket message handling
{
    "message": "user_input",
    "personalized": true,      # ← From main1.py
    "speech_speed": 1.2       # ← From main2.py
}
```

### **Frontend Controls**
```html
<!-- Unified control panel -->
<div class="input-controls">
    <button id="personalizedToggle">👤 Personalized Off</button>
    <div class="speed-control">
        <input type="range" id="speedSlider" min="0.5" max="2.0" step="0.1" value="1.0" />
        <span id="speedValue">1.0x</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Start the Application**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **Access the Interface**
- Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
